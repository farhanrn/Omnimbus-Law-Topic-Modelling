# Topic Modelling on Omnimbus Law
## Data Preprocessing
Text data is cleaned and tokenized, which involves steps like:
1. Removing punctuation and special characters.
2. Tokenizing the text.
3. Removing stop words.

## Topic Modeling
The notebook likely applies Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) or similar models to identify the main topics within the text data.

## Evaluation
Model evaluation is performed by assessing the coherence or interpretability of the generated topics, possibly using metrics like coherence score.

## Conclusion
The project helps in understanding common themes within Omnibus Law texts, which could aid in legal analysis and policy discussions.

## How to Run
1. Clone this repository and navigate to the project folder.
2. Install the required libraries.
3. Open the Jupyter notebook and run each cell sequentially.
